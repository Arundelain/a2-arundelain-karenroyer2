Like the old madlibs, this app takes two nouns and two adjectives and constructs random sentence output.

## Techanical Achievements:
- **Tech Achievement 1**: populated list elements from the scripts.js file
- **Tech Achievement 2**: randomly selected elements from an array
- **Tech Achievement 3**: sliced the appdata database to delete a user selected record
- **Tech Achievement 4**: used grid layout for css

## Design Achievements:
- **Design Achievement 1**: Accessible
- **Design Achievement 2**: recreated a frosted glass, blurred background for the center of the page
- **Design Achievement 3**: fully scalable layout
- **Design Achievement 4**: video in the background


- This is a small game
- A challenge it addresses is removing the data records a user chooses
- Future work would include improving the appearance, adding grammarly to help user enter only 
  words and fixing the text area to update after deletion.
